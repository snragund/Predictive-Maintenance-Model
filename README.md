# Predictive-Maintenance-Model

• Predicting the damage of check valve using classification methods under high pressure and temperature conditions.
• Categorising the damages using the Machine Learning Decision tree model in Python (TensorFlow / Keras).
• Built lifetime prediction (regression model) and maintenance model for check valves using industrial sensor data in python (Tensorflow/Keras).
• The industrial data is sensitive, hence it is not added.

The dataset and complete code is not available due to the confidentiality policies.
