# Predictive-Maintenance-Model

<h>• Predicting the damage of check valve using classification methods under high pressure and temperature conditions.</h>
<h>• Categorising the damages using the Machine Learning Decision tree model in Python (TensorFlow / Keras).</h>
<h>• Built lifetime prediction (regression model) and maintenance model for check valves using industrial sensor data in python (Tensorflow/Keras).</h>
• The industrial data is sensitive, hence it is not added.
